Growing up, Tiberius was often bullied for his size, and he turned to stone masonry as a form of escape. He found solace in the creation of something beautiful, and soon his work became renowned for its intricate design and impressive scale. Tiberius was happy with his life as a stone mason, and his kindness and generosity made him well-loved by all those he worked with.

However, his life changed when he was approached by a group of dwarves who were in need of his help. Their kingdom was being threatened by an evil sorcerer who sought to destroy it, and they needed Tiberius' strength to help protect it. Tiberius was reluctant at first, but he could not turn his back on those in need, and so he agreed to help.

Using his massive size and strength, Tiberius was able to protect the kingdom, and his bravery earned him the respect of all those he had helped. From that day on, Tiberius was no longer seen as a simple stone mason, but as a hero and protector.

Despite his newfound status, Tiberius remained humble, and he continued to work as a stone mason, using his skills to help those in need. He became known as Tiberius Thunder, a giant who used his strength not for destruction, but for creation and protection. His gentle spirit and selflessness earned him a place in the hearts of all those he encountered, and he continued to live a life of peace and purpose, carving beauty from stone and defending those in need."
