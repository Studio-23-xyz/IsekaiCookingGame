  Name: Keira Darkclaw
  Race: Human
  Occupation: Mage/Royal Advisor
  Backstory: 'Keira was born into a family of mages and was trained in the arcane
    arts from a young age. She was always fascinated by the power of magic and was
    determined to become a powerful mage herself. Despite her humble beginnings,
    she quickly rose through the ranks of the mage community and was eventually offered
    a position as a royal advisor.


    However, Keira''s thirst for power and her
    tendency to make decisions that favored her own interests over the kingdom''s
    led to her being branded as a power-hungry and manipulative individual. She soon
    found herself on the outs with the royal court, but instead of backing down,
    Keira doubled down on her ambition.


    She began to use her mastery of magic
    to gather information and manipulate those around her, until she had regained
    her place as a royal advisor. But Keira''s methods were not always honorable,
    and she soon found herself with more enemies than friends.


    Despite the
    danger, Keira refused to give up her position of power. She believed that she
    was meant to rule and would stop at nothing to see her ambitions fulfilled. Whether
    she is a villain or a hero remains to be seen, but one thing is certain, Keira
    Darkclaw is not someone to be trifled with.'
