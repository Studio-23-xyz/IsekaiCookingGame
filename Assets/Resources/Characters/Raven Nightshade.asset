  Name: Raven Nightshade
  Race: Vampire
  Occupation: Spy/Assassin
  Backstory: 'Raven Nightshade was once a human woman who lived in a kingdom ruled
    by the powerful dragon king, Dante Firewing. She was known for her exceptional
    skills in stealth and strategy, and her cunning wit made her a valuable asset
    to the kingdom. However, her life changed when she was bitten by a powerful vampire
    and transformed into one of the undead.


    Despite her newfound powers and
    abilities, Raven struggled to adapt to her new life as a vampire. That was until
    she was approached by Dante Firewing himself, who offered her a place in his
    court as one of his loyal spies and assassins. Raven, eager to find a place in
    the world where she felt like she belonged, eagerly accepted the offer.


    She
    quickly rose through the ranks and became one of Dante''s most trusted confidants.
    With her heightened senses and ability to blend into the shadows, Raven was able
    to gather information and carry out assassinations with ease. However, despite
    her loyalty to the king, Raven often found herself at odds with the other members
    of the court, who were wary of her powers and abilities.


    Despite the challenges
    she faced, Raven remained steadfast in her loyalty to Dante and the kingdom,
    always putting her duties as an assassin first. She took on the surname "Nightshade"
    as a symbol of her allegiance to the night and the secrets she kept for the king.


    Despite
    her fearsome reputation, Raven was not without her own vulnerabilities. She was
    haunted by memories of her past life and the many lives she had taken as an assassin.
    But she knew that in order to protect the kingdom and maintain her place in the
    court, she had to push those thoughts aside and continue to serve Dante Firewing
    to the best of her abilities.'
