  Backstory: 'Rhea Thunderbird was once known as the notorious pirate captain "Rhea
    the Phoenix." She and her crew roamed the seas, fearlessly plundering ships and
    hoarding treasure. However, one fateful day, Rhea''s ship was ambushed by a rival
    pirate crew and her entire crew, including her beloved pet serpent, were killed
    in the battle.


    The loss of her crew and pet weighed heavily on Rhea and
    she turned to music as a form of solace. Her haunting, beautiful voice soon became
    renowned throughout the land and she traded in her life as a pirate for one as
    a singer and musician. Despite her newfound fame and success, Rhea still struggles
    with the guilt of being unable to save her crew and pet, and the memory of her
    past life as a pirate haunts her.'
