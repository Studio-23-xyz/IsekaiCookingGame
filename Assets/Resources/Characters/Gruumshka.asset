  Name: Gruumshka
  Race: Half-Orc
  Occupation: Archer/Alchemist
  Backstory: 'Growing up, Gruumshka was always different from the other Half-Orcs.
    Unlike most Half-Orcs who were brutish and prone to violence, Niamh was quiet
    and reserved. Despite her differences, she was still subjected to the same prejudices
    and bigotry that plagued her people. This led to a life of hardship and poverty,
    where she was constantly on the receiving end of violence and discrimination.


    Despite
    all of this, Gruumshka was a quick learner and soon discovered her talent for
    archery and alchemy. She began to hone her skills, using her talents to make
    a living for herself and her family. However, tragedy struck when Gruumshka''s
    family was killed by a group of humans who saw them as nothing more than monsters.


    This
    event was the turning point in Gruumshka''s life. She was filled with rage and
    a thirst for revenge against the humans who had taken everything from her. She
    threw herself into her studies of alchemy and archery, using her knowledge to
    create potent poisons and deadly arrows. With these tools, she began to exact
    her revenge on those who had wronged her and her kin.


    Gruumshka''s actions
    soon attracted the attention of the local authorities, who branded her as a ruthless
    killer. She was forced to go into hiding, turning to the black market and becoming
    a mercenary for hire. Gruumshka''s once-gentle nature was now a distant memory,
    replaced by a cold-hearted determination to get revenge on all who wronged her
    kind.'
