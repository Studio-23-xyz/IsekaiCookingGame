  Name: Orion Starlight
  Race: Angel
  Occupation: Cleric/Healer
  Backstory: 'Orion Starlight was once a proud and respected angel in the heavenly
    realms. He was known for his unwavering faith, his healing powers, and his gentle
    heart. As a cleric and healer, he devoted his life to helping others, using his
    abilities to ease suffering and bring comfort to those in need.


    But one
    day, tragedy struck. During a battle between the angels and demons, Orion''s
    powers were put to the test. He tried his best to heal the wounded, but there
    were too many, and his abilities were not enough. In the end, many of his fellow
    angels were lost, including some of his closest friends.


    The loss weighed
    heavily on Orion, and he began to question his own worth. He couldn''t understand
    why he wasn''t strong enough to save everyone. Slowly, he became consumed by
    grief and self-doubt, and he started to withdraw from the world.


    As time
    passed, Orion''s once pure and virtuous heart became clouded by anger and bitterness.
    He began to see himself as a failure and felt like he didn''t deserve his place
    in heaven anymore. Eventually, his negative emotions took over, and he turned
    to a life of sin, using his powers for personal gain and becoming a rogue cleric.


    Now,
    Orion goes by the name of Gabriel, a common name for angels, but one that he
    can no longer live up to. He roams the earth, offering his services to those
    in need, but always with a hidden agenda. Some say he still has the potential
    for redemption, but only time will tell if he will ever find his way back to
    the light.'
