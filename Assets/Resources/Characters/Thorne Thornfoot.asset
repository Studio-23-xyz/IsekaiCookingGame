  Backstory: 'Thorne Thornfoot was born and raised in a small gnomish village where
    carpentry and woodworking were passed down from generations. His love for crafting
    and building started from a young age, and he showed remarkable talent in carving
    and constructing intricate wooden items. As he grew up, he honed his skills and
    became known as the best carpenter in the village.


    However, Thorne was
    never content with staying in one place and wanted to explore the world and meet
    new people. He left his village to seek out new opportunities and to find a place
    where he could truly make a difference with his skills.


    He traveled far
    and wide, offering his carpentry services to anyone in need. Thorne''s reputation
    as a skilled carpenter precedes him, and his work speaks for itself. He''s known
    for creating beautiful, high-quality pieces, each one unique and with its own
    story to tell.


    Despite the challenges and obstacles he faced along the
    way, Thorne never lost his passion for his craft. He eventually settled in a
    bustling city, where he opened up his own carpentry shop, attracting customers
    from all walks of life. Thorne has become a respected member of the community
    and continues to produce stunning works of art with his hands.'
