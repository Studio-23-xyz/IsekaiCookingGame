  Name: Anubis Jackal
  Race: Human-Animal Hybrid
  Occupation: Adventurer
  Backstory: 'Anubis Jackal was born to a human mother and a father who was a jackal-headed
    deity in ancient Egyptian mythology. Growing up, Anubis struggled with fitting
    in among both humans and animals, feeling like he didn''t belong to either group.
    He was constantly teased and bullied by other children for his unique appearance,
    causing him to become reclusive and reserved.


    Despite this, Anubis had
    a natural curiosity and thirst for adventure that led him to leave his hometown
    in search of a place where he truly belonged. Along the way, he honed his physical
    abilities and developed a keen sense of survival, relying on his wit and cunning
    to overcome challenges.


    As he travelled the world, Anubis discovered that
    he had a talent for solving mysteries and uncovering secrets, which led him to
    become an adventurer. He quickly gained a reputation as a fearless and tenacious
    investigator, willing to take on any task no matter how dangerous.


    Despite
    his success, Anubis still felt like an outsider, never quite able to shake the
    feeling of not belonging. He found solace in his work as an adventurer, knowing
    that he was helping others and making a difference in the world.


    Despite
    his gruff exterior, Anubis has a kind heart and a strong sense of justice. He
    is always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need and will stop at nothing
    to protect the innocent. Despite his tough exterior, he has a soft spot for children
    and animals, often going out of his way to make them smile.'
