  Name: Grimreap
  Race: Undead
  Occupation: Merchant
  Backstory: Grimreap was once a successful merchant, traveling the lands and trading
    goods with various races. However, one fateful day, he was ambushed by bandits
    and murdered for his wealth. He was resurrected as a revenant and now, he uses
    his newfound powers to exact his revenge on those who wronged him and to continue
    his merchant trade. Despite his undead state, Grimreap still possesses a human-like
    demeanor and a love for wealth, but the darkness and anger from his death still
    linger within him, often making him unpredictable and feared by those who cross
    his path. He sees himself as a being beyond the laws of life and death, and continues
    his business dealings with an iron fist, striking fear into the hearts of those
    who dare cheat him.
