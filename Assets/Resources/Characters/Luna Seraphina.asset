  Name: Luna Seraphina
  Race: Half-Elf
  Occupation: Poet/Artist
  Backstory: 'Luna Seraphina was born to an elf mother and a human father in a forest
    community that prized its connection to nature. Growing up, she was surrounded
    by the beauty of the forest and learned to appreciate the delicate balance between
    all living things. Her love of nature manifested in her poetry and art, which
    often celebrated the majesty of the forest and the creatures that lived there.


    However,
    as Luna grew older, she began to see the destructive impact that humans were
    having on the natural world. Loggers were destroying entire ecosystems, and people
    were burning the forests to clear land for agriculture and mining. Luna watched
    in horror as her beloved home was slowly being destroyed, and she felt helpless
    to stop it.


    One day, Luna came upon a group of humans who were setting
    fire to a grove of ancient trees. In a fit of rage, she attacked them and used
    her magic to put out the flames. It was then that she realized that her love
    of nature and her anger at those who would destroy it could be combined into
    a powerful force for change.


    Luna became a fierce advocate for the protection
    of the natural world, using her poetry and art as a way to spread her message
    of environmentalism. But her methods became more and more extreme, and she eventually
    became known as a terrorist among the human populations. Luna began targeting
    those she saw as the greatest threats to the natural world, and she became feared
    and reviled by many.


    Despite this, Luna refused to back down from her beliefs.
    She saw herself as a defender of the natural world and would stop at nothing
    to protect it, even if it meant becoming a villain in the eyes of those she once
    loved.'
