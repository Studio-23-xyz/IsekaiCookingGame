  Name: Tiberius Thunder
  Race: Giant
  Occupation: Stone Mason
  Backstory: 'Tiberius Thunder, a giant, lived a peaceful life in the mountains,
    using his immense strength to craft intricate structures from stone. Despite
    his intimidating appearance, Tiberius was a gentle soul, who used his skills
    to create beautiful structures for the communities nearby.


    Growing up,
    Tiberius was often bullied for his size, and he turned to stone masonry as a
    form of escape. He found solace in the creation of something beautiful, and soon
    his work became renowned for its intricate design and impressive scale. Tiberius
    was happy with his life as a stone mason, and his kindness and generosity made
    him well-loved by all those he worked with.


    However, his life changed when
    he was approached by a group of dwarves who were in need of his help. Their kingdom
    was being threatened by an evil sorcerer who sought to destroy it, and they needed
    Tiberius'' strength to help protect it. Tiberius was reluctant at first, but
    he could not turn his back on those in need, and so he agreed to help.


    Using
    his massive size and strength, Tiberius was able to protect the kingdom, and
    his bravery earned him the respect of all those he had helped. From that day
    on, Tiberius was no longer seen as a simple stone mason, but as a hero and protector.


    Despite
    his newfound status, Tiberius remained humble, and he continued to work as a
    stone mason, using his skills to help those in need. He became known as Tiberius
    Thunder, a giant who used his strength not for destruction, but for creation
    and protection. His gentle spirit and selflessness earned him a place in the
    hearts of all those he encountered, and he continued to live a life of peace
    and purpose, carving beauty from stone and defending those in need.'
