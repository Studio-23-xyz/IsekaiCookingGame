  Backstory: 'Ivan Iceheart was born in a small coastal village, surrounded by the
    harsh, unforgiving sea. Despite the tough environment, he was a cheerful and
    hardworking child, who often helped his parents with their fishing business.
    However, Ivan''s life took a dramatic turn when his parents were lost at sea
    during a severe storm. With no one else to turn to, Ivan was forced to fend for
    himself and take over the family business.


    As he grew older, Ivan''s reputation
    as a skilled fisherman and fair trader began to spread. He became known for his
    ability to catch the biggest fish in the sea and his unwavering determination
    to survive. But Ivan''s life was not all sunshine and rainbows. He faced many
    challenges, including greedy merchants who sought to exploit him and the constant
    threat of harsh weather and dangerous sea creatures.


    Despite the difficulties,
    Ivan remained optimistic and persevered, using his wits and cunning to overcome
    any obstacles in his way. He became an expert in negotiating favorable deals,
    and his business prospered, allowing him to provide for himself and the people
    he loved.


    One day, Ivan was approached by a mysterious figure who offered
    him a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to expand his trading empire. The figure
    promised Ivan wealth beyond his wildest dreams in exchange for his loyalty and
    services.


    Ivan was torn between his desire for wealth and his loyalty to
    his friends and family. He eventually accepted the offer, not realizing that
    he was stepping into a dangerous world of politics and manipulation. As he was
    drawn deeper into the intrigue, Ivan discovered that the figure was a powerful
    wizard with a hidden agenda.


    Now, Ivan is caught in a web of deceit, and
    he must find a way to free himself and those he loves before it''s too late.
    He uses his wit and cunning to navigate the dangerous world of politics, all
    while trying to maintain his moral compass and protect his loved ones from harm.'
