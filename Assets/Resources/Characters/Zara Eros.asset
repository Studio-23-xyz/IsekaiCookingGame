  Backstory: 'Zara Stormborn, a succubus, lived a life of temptation and seduction,
    using her powers to feed on the desires of mortals. However, everything changed
    when she met Azura Moonstone. Azura''s grace and beauty captured Zara''s heart
    and she fell deeply in love with her. However, she knew that as a succubus, she
    was not meant for love. But she could not control her feelings and decided to
    win Azura''s affection by becoming a cook and chef, hoping to impress her with
    her culinary skills.


    She spent years perfecting her craft and even went
    as far as to abandon her succubus ways, but she soon realizes that winning Azura''s
    heart won''t be easy, especially with the player trying to beat her to it. Regardless,
    Zara remains determined and is willing to do anything to make Azura hers, even
    if it means going back to her old ways and using her powers of seduction to her
    advantage.'
