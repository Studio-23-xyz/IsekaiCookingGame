  Name: Caelan Night
  Race: Orc
  Occupation: Farmer/Herbalist
  Backstory: 'Caelan Night was born in a remote orc farming village, surrounded by
    lush forests and rolling hills. From a young age, he was fascinated by the world
    of herbs and plants, and took up farming as a way to learn more about them. Caelan
    was particularly skilled at growing and harvesting rare and exotic plants, which
    he would then sell to wealthy buyers who sought their therapeutic and magical
    properties.


    However, as he grew older, Caelan became disillusioned with
    the limitations placed on him as a farmer. He yearned for adventure and excitement,
    and was not content to spend the rest of his life tending the same fields. Thus,
    he began to explore the darker side of the herb trade, operating in secret as
    a black market trader. He would acquire and sell exotic plants that were either
    banned or highly illegal, and often had to use his cunning and wit to evade the
    authorities.


    Despite the danger, Caelan found that he enjoyed the thrill
    of his double life. He quickly became one of the most sought-after traders in
    the black market, and gained a reputation for his discerning eye and unrivaled
    knowledge of herbs. However, as he grew more successful, Caelan also grew more
    arrogant. He began to take greater risks, and eventually drew the attention of
    the local authorities.


    Caelan was eventually caught, and was faced with
    the prospect of a lifetime in prison. However, he was offered a deal: work as
    a spy for the authorities, using his connections in the black market to gather
    information about other traders and smugglers. Caelan accepted the offer, and
    became a double agent, playing both sides against each other and using his knowledge
    of the herb trade to his advantage.


    Now, Caelan continues to work as a
    farmer by day and a black market trader by night. He is torn between his desire
    for adventure and his loyalty to his people. Despite his often villainous intentions,
    Caelan is driven by a fierce sense of justice and a love for the natural world,
    and will stop at nothing to protect it.'
