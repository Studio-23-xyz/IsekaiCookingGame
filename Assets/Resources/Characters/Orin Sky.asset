  Name: Orin Sky
  Race: Goblin
  Occupation: Shoemaker/Tailor
  Backstory: 'Orin Sky was a goblin born and raised in a small goblin community near
    the borders of a great kingdom. Despite being a goblin, Orin was not interested
    in the usual goblin hobbies such as thievery, pillaging, and causing chaos. Instead,
    he was fascinated with the art of shoemaking and tailoring. He spent most of
    his days observing and learning from the human shoemakers and tailors in the
    nearby towns, eventually becoming a skilled artisan himself.


    However, his
    passion for his craft was not well-received by the goblin community, who saw
    it as a waste of time and resources. Orin faced constant ridicule and persecution
    from his own kind, causing him to leave his home and start a life in the human
    towns.


    Despite the initial skepticism and prejudice he faced, Orin quickly
    gained recognition for his exceptional shoemaking and tailoring skills. He quickly
    rose to fame as the go-to shoemaker and tailor for the wealthy and influential
    members of society.


    However, as much as Orin loved his craft, he was also
    driven by a desire for wealth and power. In secret, he began to take on shady
    clients and deal in the black market, using his knowledge of human society to
    his advantage. He became a master of disguise, sneaking into the most prestigious
    events and gatherings to make deals with the most influential people in the kingdom.


    Despite
    the danger and risks, Orin was driven by his ambition and greed, determined to
    be the wealthiest and most powerful goblin to ever live. His notoriety grew,
    and soon, he became known throughout the land as the cunning and elusive goblin
    trader, feared and respected by all who knew him.'
